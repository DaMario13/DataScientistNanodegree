## Motivation

This project is motivated by my Udacity Nanodegree. Therefor I was anlayzing the Stack Overlfow Survey Data from 2019. 
You can find the Data [here](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey).

During the analysis I answered the following questions. 

1. Which age group has the highest job satisfaction?
2. Which impact has the age and gender on the salary?
3. How well can we predict an indivudals working hours per week? Which aspects correlate well to the working hours per week?

The results you can see in the file StackOverflowSurveyAnalysis.ipynb 
Because the Data Set is not in the github repository you have to download it with the link above and put it into
the same folder as the StackOverflowSurveyAnalysis file.
